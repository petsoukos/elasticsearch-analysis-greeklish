Greeklish Token Filter for ElasticSearch
========================================

* Originally created by Skrotz, but abandoned since 2020 and was left for 
version 7.7 of ElasticSearch. If I'll find the time I'll create releases
and documentation.

The Greeklish plugin generates tokens with latin characters from greek tokens.

The generated tokens have the save position and the same offset with the
original greek tokens.
